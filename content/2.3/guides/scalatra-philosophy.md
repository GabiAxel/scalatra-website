<h4>1. Start small, build upwards</h4>

Start with a small core, and have lots of easy integrations for common tasks.

<h4>2. Freedom</h4>

Allow the user freedom to choose whatever structure and libraries make the most sense for the application being built. 

<h4>3. Solid, but not stolid </h4>

Use solid base components. For instance, servlets aren't cool, but they are 
extremely stable and have a huge community behind them. At the same time, work 
to advance the state of web application development by using new techniques
and approaches.


<h4>4. Love HTTP</h4>

Embrace HTTP and its stateless nature. People get into trouble when they fool themselves into thinking things which aren't true - fancy server-side tricks to give an illusion of statefulness aren't for us.
