# Scalatra documentation site

This is the documentation website for the [Scalatra](http://scalatra.org) microframework.

It's built as a Hugo static site. If you want to work on it:

* Install Hugo from https://gohugo.io/
* `cd` into the root directory of the docs site
* enter `hugo serve` at your console prompt

A Hugo webserver should fire up, and present a rendered version of the site content. Editing any of the Markdown files in the `/content/` folder should cause the page you've worked on to automatically regenerate and refresh.
